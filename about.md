## So what is this blog all about?

Mostly its a space for me to keep track of different things I do to my laptop and it's software. 

The blog is hosted on [Reclaim Hosting](http://www.reclaimhosting.com). They offer cheap domain name registration and hosting to educational projects and take a very liberal view of what that covers. They're also really helpful when you run into problems which is great.

At the moment I'm running Fedora 20 and while I enjoy it I also break things on a regular enough basis. I search forums and stackexchange to fix it and usually solve the problem by mixing a couple of different solutions. 

Then some time later I'll break it again and have to figure out how I solved it, read through solutions, half remember that they didn't quite work the last time and try to figure out why ... I'll learn something and then a certain time later I'll break something else and the whole process starts again.

so for now I'll try to document what I do here. So that I have a convenient way to look things up and so that other people going through the same problems might find an answer too.
