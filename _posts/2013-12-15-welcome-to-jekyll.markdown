This is me editing my first Jekyll post. At the time of writing I'm having lots of trouble with it.

I'm blogging with Jekyll for a couple of reasons.

* I like the idea of a static html site vulnerable to less attacks
* I also like the idea of using markdown and it seemd like once you get the hang of it, it should make writing fairly quick
* Finally using Jekyll is an opportunity to use git. 

On the last point:  
I'm hoping to learn a bit of basic programming this year and I know myself enough to know that I need to be learning something implementable. While git isn't programming it is a way to check code out, and maybe alter it, and send the alteration on to someone else. Learning how to commit blog changes isn't the worst start.

So far so not so great on that front though. I tried setting up a `post-receive hook` for deployment and that didn't work out. I'll try again when I get the hang of jekyll itself.
