GIMP as people may know is one of the best known open sorce image editors, and is the one most mentioned when people talk about alternatives to Photoshop.

While it has been developed for xy number of years it still draws flak for being "an image editor developed by engineers" rather than creatives or UX focused developers.

While on the one hand Photoshop and the rest of the Abobe suite, by moving to a subscription model, have probably heralded the end of widespread piracy, thus opening up potential users for GIMP, on the other hand there has been a rise in teh number of seeminglu conscious webbased Photoshop clones such as Pixlr, or more capable basic packages such as Paint.NET which must eat into the potential userbase of GIMP.

Other well known complaints or shortcomings are the lack of a non-destructive editing process and the 'export to' rather than 'save as' route for comon image formats. Finally for a lot of critics the biggest problem with GIMP is the appearance, that it looks different to Photoshop, which they deem to be not only the best image processing programme, but the standard image processing programme.

In light of all that a guide to GIMP has many potential audiences and arguments to address. Not only to be an engaging and insightful guide to a piece of software but also to show how that software can fulfill a variety of usecases and in effect to demonstrate that the software can respond successfully to much of the criticism levelled at it.

And the introduction to the book plays up to the 'graphic software designed by engineers' stereotype. The first three paragraphs give a rote definition of 'free software'. The next three give the licence conditions for the distribuiton of GIMP and finish with the following response to feature requests "If you want it so badly, make it and share it with the rest of us!".
Not a reassuring post for those looking for a capable, user friendly piece of software.
